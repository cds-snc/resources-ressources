# Learning resources / Ressources d'apprentissage

Creating, curating, and maintaining a centralized space to share CDS learnings that can help build digital capacity in the Government of Canada and improve how we design and deliver services. 

CrÃ©er, conserver et maintenir un espace centralisÃ© pour partager les apprentissages du SNC qui pourraient aider Ã  renforcer notre capacitÃ© numÃ©rique au sein du gouvernement du Canada et amÃ©liorer la faÃ§on dont on conÃ§oit et offre des services.

# Overview 
This app is built using [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/). Data is pulled in from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

## I18N / Bilingual support.
This app is set up to support both of Canada's official languages, English (Canada) and French (Canada). It uses [nuxt/i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) to manage app languages.
The text used in the website is pulled from the json files inside the `locales` directory. To add text, simply add a variable to both json files and access it using {{ $t('your_variable_name') }} within the app.

## Layouts
A few common, reusable components have been created, which can be found under the `app/components` folder. To easily create pages, we have a few different layouts depending on what page the user is looking at. These layouts uses the components and can be found under the `app/layouts` folder.

## CSS
This app uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for its CSS framework. On dev mode, you can easily access colors and helpers by visiting [http://localhost:3000/_tailwind/](http://localhost:3000/_tailwind/)

## Storybook
_Note: We are not actively using storybook right now, so this feature and corresponding documentation needs to be revisited._

Storybook is integrated in this app to make UI components easier to manage and to be explored. 
To run storybook locally, simply type `npm run storybook` which makes it available at [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/)

# Local Development

**Prerequisites**

- [Node 16 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**Installation**


1. Configure the environment variables for Contentful.
```bash
$ export contentful_access_token=""

$ chmod +x scripts/set_envs.sh

# Set other env vars
$ . scripts/set_envs.sh
```
2. Change into the `/app` directory.

3. On a terminal, install the  node packages and dependencies. You may need to include `--legacy-peer-deps`
```bash
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
4. Run the development server
```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```
5. Go to a browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 


**ðŸŽ‰ You're done for now, but there are a few more optional things you may want to explore.**
- [Generate a static website and serve the static files](#generate-a-static-website-and-serve-the-static-files)
- [Build with SSR](#build-with-ssr)
- [Run both french and english](#run-both-french-and-english)
- [Committing to the repo](#committing-to-the-repo)

### Generate a static website and serve the static files
```bash
# make sure config in nuxt.config.js is set to
#   target: static
#   ssr: false
# generate static project
$ npm run generate
$ npm run start
```

### Build with SSR
To test the build for production with server-side rendering you need to build first and then run the server.

_Note: This setup is not used by our application_
```bash
# build for production and launch server
# make sure config in nuxt.config.js is set to
#   target: server
#   ssr: true
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

### Run both french and english
The website is currently set to run on different domains on production. This makes it slightly tricky to test locally. The quickest way 
to test both the french and english version of the site on your local machine, you may need to do a few extra manual steps.
   1. Serve the static files (see step 6)
   2. Verify that your domain envs are set (the `set_env_vars.sh` script should have set these)
```bash
$ echo $DOMAIN_EN $DOMAIN_FR
en.learning-resources:8080 fr.learning-resources:8080
```
   3. Modify your hosts file
```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       en.learning-resources
127.0.0.1       fr.learning-resources
```

### Committing to the repo
Committing to the repo from your local machine may require a few extra steps.

**Conventional Commits**

The initial setup of NuxtJS added the option to have conventional commits on the repo. Isn't that fun?
This requires committers to use [conventional commit syntax](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) to ensure a cleaner commit history.

This step is set up in the root folder though, using commitlint. Which requires the extra step of installing it on the **_root_** folder.

`npm run install`

**Linting**

There are lint checks, and it would be nice to have a git hook to ensure linting. 

To check your linting, run `npm run lint`. 

Most lint issues can be quickly fixed by the command `npm run lintfix`

**Terraform**

If making changes to the terraform files, we have a github workflow that detects these changes, shows the plan and applies them after the PR gets merged.

Format your terraform files by running `make fmt` and `make hclfmt` inside the `infrastructure/` folder.


**Pull Requests**

If you cloned the repo, you would have noticed that the default branch is `staging`. The deployment process can be found on our infrastructure documentation for further understanding.
To open a Pull Request, make sure you are merging your PR into `staging`.

Before merging:
- Make sure your PR is passing
- It is recommended to ask for a PR Review before merging.

AWS Amplify will create a PR Preview URL for your changes. The only thing you will be unable to test on this URL is switching languages.g

# Frequently Asked Questions
- [What is the `frontend` folder?](#what-is-the-frontend-folder)
- [How to do translation within the app](#how-to-do-translation-within-the-app)

## What is the `frontend` folder?

The `frontend` folder contains the files needed to migrate to [Nuxt3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/). Unfortunately, the release date for Nuxt3 is unknown, so we have decided to remain on Nuxt2 in the meantime. There is a [github issue](https://github.com/cds-snc/resources-ressources/issues/211) to delete the folder but keep it on a separate branch.

## How to do translation within the app

The [nuxt-i18n plugin](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) handles the translation files. Only apply changes under the `app/` folder to avoid duplication and unnecessary work (which means, ignore the `frontend/` folder for now ðŸ˜…).

The translation files are located in the `app/locales` directory, namely:

- `en.json`

- `fr.json`

**How do I format translation variables?**

You would need to name the word/sentence with a variable, then define that variable in a translation file `*.json`
The translation file is in a JSON format.

Sample sentence:

`en.json`
```json
{
  "landing_page": {
    "title": "Welcome to CDS Learning Resources"
  }
}
```
`fr.json`
```json
{
  "landing_page": {
    "title": "Bienvenue aux ressources d'apprentissage du SNC"
  }
}
```
You may now use this variable in any of the components like this
```vue
<h1>{{ $t('landing_page.title') }}</h1>
```

There are many [more formatting options](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/formatting.html) available to you on the `vue-i18n` documentation. These include [pluralization](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/pluralization.html#accessing-the-number-via-the-pre-defined-argument), [date and time localization](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/datetime.html), and [number and curency localization](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/number.html#custom-formatting).


**What if I forget to translate something?**

Nuxt-i18n uses vue-i18n under the hood, so it will output a warning on the console.

If no translation can be found:
```
[vue-i18n] Value of key 'hello' is not a string!
```

For missing translations, the default behaviour is to fallback to English.

On `app/config/i18n.js`, `fallbackLocale` is set to `en`. This is mostly for the benefit of developers, so if this is not the desired setting, please feel free to open a ticket.

Here's what a missing translation warning looks like when it has fallen back to English:
```
[vue-i18n] Fall back to translate the keypath 'hello' with 'en' locale.
```

There is no current and automated way to detect missing translations. It would be nice to have the JSON files automatically generated in the future.
